458795a6-8531-46da-823a-4259c0a0069f:Kinda. We live on a farm near the river. I swam it.

c4c4816f-df6b-4e08-82dc-ca7f828cc2d3:She died, but she 
544d4c8e-59ac-4780-9d9c-00fc1c94bd6f:It's okay man. We're all here with you.
ecb27627-d86f-4f2c-86b1-01de78801d70:I ran. Swam the river... somehow. 
0d6296cb-c4e7-403d-b461-49e7f6e8641a:She's still there.

23f1ce69-a66d-4c8d-9ef0-7cb860a8f07f:What if you don't have a gun Mike?
c0c136b0-efed-4b22-9c8a-3322df2e9842:Then you find a goddamn gun.
c57f7391-099f-4cf1-8231-4a7acdc426f3:Bullets to the torso... limbs... they don't slow them.
977044c2-9d39-4869-8f21-c6380c267185:And they sure as hell don't make them hurt.
0ad2c6f8-8108-4888-93ed-ad036d5e30bc:Go for the brain. 
db9428eb-046c-4b83-8779-64ea1c11d719:Hell, if you lose your gun then use a bat.

6f868e01-2fd0-4365-b448-8e9128b5ebef:Ill bodies. People with the infection.
0b3e3d3a-4dc0-48b6-9c68-e1cecd4e62aa:They're just lying at the side of the road.
7ff2541b-d488-4f9f-bf85-2a042cccfe98:People are ignoring them, but they know they're there.
a5918367-1c9e-48c5-985d-963f8ccc17f7:They're gonna come back. Everyone knows it.
cd177d3e-e4dd-4ff7-8e7e-f9b085db080e:Just no-one's got the guts.
92114910-5b43-4970-9adb-f1502462652a:No-one wants to do it.
26b9608b-a7d1-4c73-aefd-cdd0bcd47d83:Not yet.
867be425-08ef-4c51-ab43-47717edec083:They just want to move on.
baf39404-bfdb-40ca-a860-ea61ee7b9f61:Get away.
516a6b11-7736-4ef2-a343-3703330876e5:But up ahead there'll be more bodies. Not quite dead.
27c46c54-69c7-4462-b9e6-57cded262e3a:And someone's got to do it.
29e38bd0-c537-4d0a-9fbc-c616c408e8f2:Someone's got to do it.
6d9f4f24-6743-4230-8472-6cf576aff3a3:Can you do it Brian?
ab02ce8c-85d7-40db-8344-90221623a8d8:I'll find that out further up the road.
19699791-ebf9-4481-a6e9-cf670f994a84:Keep safe.
8cdaa4c7-1f2a-48fb-b89c-3a071d67c699:I'll try.
1d40da5e-8d7c-4c51-bc4a-8a23d7822c85:So what are the facts? 
72d58f1c-a427-453f-8825-dfceb6c81464:They're dead. They bite. You don't want to get close.
e508bd12-a67c-41bd-94e8-5fa08ff6b17c:For God knows what reason, the truth has been kept from us.
467622f8-1838-4cd2-b197-7ae1bdd97eba:They've got it pinned, but for how long?
858494a9-0327-4dbb-ac2f-01aa3cdcad6d:Do you know anything else? We need NEW information.
062af941-881c-40d9-bfd0-c15dedfd0698:Call me. Let's get through this together.
163621ca-4945-41f0-a1e7-4467e884d53e:Mary, you there?
58cc4e9d-5a16-4361-89b2-66b53e1acdff:The Army are killing us! My Dad. He didn't even have a scratch!
6f7cccd7-111d-4b52-995f-65e7cedcaa63:You're... kidding?
b37cfbdb-2bc5-4b64-b537-d553987035fe:The soldier said he was sorry, and he shot him!
910a4962-c341-4839-92f6-f35b7afa3f29:Turned the gun on me, then... 
582da8bb-a563-400e-96fd-d40c91418024:... then he blew his own damn head off.

7428308a-3c7a-4e8f-af32-05b03fc29652:Only... some are crawling on the floor. 
95301c54-0991-4762-b465-428a5a7b0e28:They're eating Janine. 
e9c08ec7-7465-467f-a016-fd5cce1d2b0b:They pulled her down. And...
85643fae-dba9-483a-877f-8e7a65dd035d:There's blood everywhere.
12756c4b-4c45-4fcf-8585-1c3c770dfe57:People are turning. Turning fast.

32ad1738-1cd5-46d8-a0a5-bd55e5a4d41b:Latoya has news everyone.
184f2fc8-3b31-4869-96e5-9606883fb49e:They're closing the bridges!

baf97375-d69a-4f90-9dc3-9ccb7744fef9:All of them. Everyone headed north through Louisville...
4937375d-c126-4b78-8b15-1bc46f2f9a78:...you're not gonna make it! 
fbb011d6-1899-4b7d-84eb-db10b5c8c57c:How do you mean closing?
531d7582-2774-49c8-86e8-6305afe09108:No cars can get over, it's gridlock!
1793326c-a301-4ae8-a1aa-486500710ac0:People were just running over with bags...

1b765f67-ca6c-473c-a57e-c445b8026eac:Just a big nothing.

96bebe05-e168-42c5-8465-2c573d27848d:Something that hates us, and wants us consumed.

433e32a5-0f17-4c37-96e9-a96ebd321f71:No-one knows how. No-one knows why.
71bf053e-e103-446f-8c21-dc20e14d1636:It's in England, and it's in Africa.
844bfd46-eb62-4c46-9686-47bc8c3a1a8f:There's pictures of the flu, there's pictures of the infection.

51dbe8ec-96fe-4b62-9a64-d05abd3c4981:Maybe it was everywhere all at once to begin with.
186ae150-e894-4d8a-a98a-4fcc4d37225b:It's out of control.
fb846d80-a2f9-4d70-a872-ae27dba1dd18:We will be taking no more calls on crackpot theories.
b073d417-6b6c-4d2d-ab3a-165dc0281318:Today is all about helping people.
75a80f13-1ab8-4f30-9490-918aeedaeb93:Helping us get through.
fb332e23-2849-4305-a416-4928d2dbdb7f:Some say there's an immunity.

9731e1f3-8c15-4f8f-b75f-e3d0adcb96e2:Someone call in.

52a45758-428a-4a83-8e8b-ba6382c20b63:I'd be confused too, if I woke up and someone had built a military cordon round me!
4741957a-b74b-4c64-8f8e-249dd5ace820:But they've got scientists to talk to now. Guys in chemical suits.

ababea01-9490-4060-935e-6f78b5acb0b6:Too many people shouting 'conspiracy', hearing unverified gunshots.
d6d15438-7adc-4257-8651-b55531b4cc93:No situation is perfect people.
65b91e07-7ca4-46ae-a030-e9477c26c3aa:This is a war. A war on whatever this thing is.
8f4f637c-085d-4e97-afdb-a49b8f66b1fb:And, together, it is a war the United States will win.

86f8dea8-5ce1-4ff2-9b5d-4b065edb7392:The guy said 'there's no way they're going hungry in there'.
ca525ef8-2ddb-40e5-bbb9-1149075aa8b0:But all we have is the word of these... dudes with guns!
1c88bc59-edb4-4707-ad1e-5efa02066f67:Where the hell's the President in all this?
be7f05e5-a06f-43f8-970c-cf5f420bb8d2:He should be down here with me! With me in this damn tent!
36e526a9-ac00-4185-80c8-87ae3d85f930:It's a sad state of affairs down there.

7110295d-dda6-405c-b130-3e098a173344:Running a fever, feeling confused, being trapped...
3a32eb81-2a2d-4219-b9f8-81ef34d3e24a:But this is clearly in the nation's interest.
2522e486-dd02-4088-a5a0-a9eae48cc17a:The greater good.
2a7e2db6-c1d7-48a4-827f-bdbea124fdf2:I've heard a lot of people asking - 'Why can't we know?'
b629054e-8291-40a0-96df-e24d51cd114b:Why can't the Government just say: 'Here's the problem'?
7cf44fc3-2015-4e77-b098-7ab0dcdb35bd:There's bravery in silence, folks.
2b83ef40-a51e-4c58-95a4-99ace4603865:They're busy looking in on this... let's call it a 'Knox Event'
a3a057ab-5f2f-43f5-b47d-6411ff6e63b4:They don't have time to look back out.
9f5d0905-c082-4980-b5ec-c45bf427286a:They're relying on us to keep calm and have faith.
f3f85f0b-5faf-4a45-8f36-8f6bae34950d:I do have faith, and as an American...
a0b52ab3-a278-4904-bd09-2d6ee260e206:... so should you.
99fa3a2e-87fc-4870-b328-2341eca7a281:I've been Judge Matt Hass...
1721bc88-74f0-4083-b4fc-100be1337c1b:... on Triple-N.
ad0808fe-f6fa-47c8-ba9a-a12fd7e7a9dc:That was Judge Matt Hass. Good evening, you're on Triple N.
15b338f5-e47e-4798-9e67-16041cde6e16:While we've been on air: a statement from the White House.
5f6f8964-4880-421c-bdd5-80ca748188a4:The President has claimed he is 'understandably distressed' by the Knox Event.
ac2bea79-5758-4725-96f2-444c1023f773:This is a distressing time.
0cda2c61-438d-416f-8616-d11647f1321c:The situation in Kentucky is unexpected and saddening.
79f45080-980b-4e04-95ba-e99c0ea45a23:My first thoughts are with the friends and families of those within the Zone.
ba65d160-644d-4e8c-abf0-86874f4282b2:People have been separated, folk have been evacuated...
1b01e39b-ad53-43b7-8628-2ebffb1750f5:I understand the difficulties facing us.
71a77462-0c64-4ecc-884c-95eb5220e4a2:However, I have faith in the fine people of the Center for Disease Control...
55d93b4d-5ea2-4b76-a96f-90dd9fa057dd:... to get to the root of the panic and confusion within the Exclusion Zone.
136d8e73-9c5a-43c1-bf7a-ea4cee1396af:I have faith in our Servicemen and Women to fulfill their duties...
32a42867-1453-4f82-a127-0c6281c92867:... and for General John McGrew to command them with the foresight and dedication...
5c4f6fa6-ebcd-4ecb-a43f-a0f13638d24c:... he has shown throughout his exemplary career.
647585d4-1a73-40c9-933d-b19c3317c47b:It is a distressing time America, but you are in safe hands.

bf106674-5557-49ed-9ea5-7fcfbef67804:Good morning. This is Triple-N.
800d60d5-c583-4bc2-8668-1d22c8758007:As the Knox Event enters its fifth day. Anger is at boiling point. 
5a6b9dd7-16da-4bf2-8f37-184127d02ff0:America demands answers. Reporting from Washington: Daniel Sinclair.
2eed5720-62a2-4f5e-9078-b901b65e00b2:Republicans in the building behind me are in uproar today.
bf45e0e8-ba0b-4315-9b61-f2eb96d38e02:Their problem? The 'do nothing' agenda of the President.
69307737-d4f3-4f7d-b97e-5e80a808f8fd:To many, the President's address yesterday simply was not enough:
8128aa39-49ef-4ad1-a279-40316bba6b1f:This is a distressing time.
f9885ce4-cd61-475b-9aec-152060088b44:The situation in Kentucky is unexpected and saddening.

13aa588a-d765-44e4-a72a-98c2b39e5cea:Critics of the administration point to at best an inability to share information...
6e8d1f2d-705a-4581-a447-fc405206810a:... and at worst a reluctance.
50775aa7-ebdc-487d-baa4-db9d1ca9e0d4:Back to the studio.
07335259-bd3d-4df0-b0cd-45195920e3fa:Thank you Daniel.
118756bf-db4f-4303-bd07-10867849eb7f:Now, Triple-N has received a statement overnight from the State Department.
d62cf80d-9370-47c4-a102-253175730071:General John McGrew have apologised for a 'lack of clarity'.
581fef8d-820d-49c1-980b-2b5e3c198591:He underlines that the unspecified outbreak IS contained. 
83f062ce-80ad-4fd2-9c21-36acebe4c6ea:Military Health officials state that fatalities within the Zone are... 
97dc4e01-f4a1-4863-be93-a6af3af576bd:...NOT currently a concern.
8ed28337-cbcd-484d-b0f6-28c986967fa1:Later today we've been promised a full and frank conversation... 
f2964b0a-08b5-4bb7-9489-f3a00e6e1414:...talking to one of the scientists operating on the boundary. 
3abe58fc-d805-4624-9cf4-adf3872499a9:More developments as they happen...
69604aa7-7c2b-4856-a0a7-e95b2efe00f0:... on Triple-N.
5c0ed7b3-6bb4-44c4-a074-898a644ac9ee:This is Triple-N. 
0cad3eab-834a-415d-bd64-29c090340cd2:Flu-like'. 'Panic'. 'Confusion'.
9580fbdf-bbaf-485a-bd20-d40b12f74ef3:An unknown communicable illness that has cut through Kentucky communities...
b06bb004-3f46-450e-87cd-c0d95de2195b:...forcing evacuations, and the creation of a huge exclusion zone.
dac0a515-12bd-4a34-afc4-aa7232a837aa:Yet STILL no concrete word on what the Knox Event is, or how it spreads.
61116350-6886-4e13-bd54-a83985ce2836:Worse? Revelations from a Dr Jack Galbraithe - a former scientist with the CDC.
aa7aa9b6-a2c1-4f05-91b8-ec92e85c9c28:He's reported as saying: 'America is not ready for this'.
b1102d69-761a-4f1d-a4e8-a7559fed85e6:'We haven't been ready for a long time.'
38e536b5-d420-401d-a882-adfd677f9e83:How does that sound to you on the ground at the Event boundary, Kirsty Cormick?
a6698a96-263a-49d6-ae28-b1ad260ce285:Well Joan, it's exactly that sort of rumor that's not helping.
8dc72ed3-0298-4fb5-8888-1ce2c3fb9beb:People just don't know what to do, and the military don't know what to do with them.
1d04b055-1894-4815-87b6-2c157d589392:Some have been taken to Louisville - but most?
5fa4b879-0315-4f17-bbb3-7d35aa3a509d:They want to stay - in tents, in local buildings. This is their home.
ba371734-10ba-4750-95bd-7d5db07418af:Or, at least as near to their homes as the Army will allow them.
4a9501ff-23c1-424e-9a73-d7e3d91b6c32:And they're angry. Real angry.
fec33769-7318-4c22-a704-6b255e391521:They're not tellin' us nothing!
d0b04dac-bb9c-4ae0-a4fb-435f91d603a3:Every day like the last!
76e5c032-1e1b-4de4-9eff-7e79e646f051:I got a business in there, in West Point!
c9cd6cc6-7f14-4947-9c9f-d4ce24445099:I got a home! A family!
d4e16adf-ce2c-4d11-98e7-76b1188e6326:I've got a dog too, and they took it for no reason at all!
3ecb94cf-cbfa-4cfa-b9da-459aef865e1d:We want answers!
2434e2aa-cbeb-41d5-9ef9-1c56f289c5d2:This is Kirsty Cormick on the Knox Event line. Back to the studio.
454bf29e-3639-40aa-9a54-9fa2c48af91a:Thank you Kirsty.
35477a99-1fe7-4a62-8b0a-2cc50cd6375a:Now, coming up - the scientist that says 'it IS contained'...
8a6f4201-4151-455c-87a8-6aaa1f4efee7:... on Triple-N.
06fe18a6-beaa-40d6-aad7-1f6d2b2dab51:This is Triple-N, here with Professor John Ramirez.
a29f8ec0-5165-4338-90fe-fa2737c24239:What's going on Professor? 
486bd77e-7960-4484-95d5-a09c7831bf31:Can you describe the illness that's spreading in there?
b3cfa702-d9eb-4b0f-9b49-54a82d94998b:I'm sorry, but that's all classified. 
5f8597d1-8ddd-410b-bc4b-e1dac8d73401:I can confirm, though, that it's a fever. And initial symptoms can turn to panic and confusion.
a38bcce3-4b30-4e31-bf06-9b25167bb69c:We have experts on-site.
6284c735-b829-4677-93c0-2259bdf715b2:And what of the rumors of violence inside the Exclusion Zone?
608fc334-0a99-4dbf-95f8-57c6d28a9602:We've got the spread of the illness contained...
12eaeae0-8f5f-4799-a972-8bdf8cc3f692: ...and the best minds we've got working on it.
1d62a391-74fc-463f-884c-ab297f14b132:Right now we have NO reason to believe folks won't recover.
ec76df47-36e3-4312-a406-09a1455e12f8:The way this started was highly contagious. 
c1d020d2-1053-4733-a579-9809449fe241:And that's why we, quickly and efficiently, locked the place down.
6cb5a2ec-1ccf-47ba-9cc8-982ea672692e:During the Vietnam War there was a lot of chemical testing conducted in this area.
79369f9c-69f1-4098-a8c7-f5047777ad70:Is there a link?
5ce788f1-dc67-49c7-adf3-4decb85d5c95:We don't think so, no ma'am.
b51dc589-09d5-441e-8b1e-d8f3352410de:Thank you.
24fbfb19-e7a0-4f61-8f13-0d2166d1f5cb:We're going straight over to Washington now, and Daniel Sinclair.
3caa4f11-a6e2-4fd4-9ec1-acadcc701ca5:Daniel - can you hear me?
fef0a2dd-d37e-46db-ad1f-6b566862b096:I can. Yes. 
6ce3301e-cfd6-4e42-9441-f8e84b54c723:As you can see in the scenes behind me...
9f70ea82-5ca5-45ba-a1d2-264a32ee55f2:... there is a huge number of protesters here today.
0519e40d-d10b-4d0f-a881-21d3c4c3a774:All angry and all wearing surgical masks: partly from solidarity...
1caf8b35-6def-448a-880e-73b7bd2b23cd:... and perhaps from fear.
7fab8e34-081e-4b9f-a134-e091761b95fd:We've heard talk of fighting, Daniel.
dca5cb60-eb87-4d29-bf38-75b07108dff6:Yes, there have been strong words - and unwise actions.
07f70824-b03a-411f-8433-6bc9a749f9f4:Localized fighting, swiftly dealt with by police officers.
5f21c9c6-c5f2-468e-8502-7e84b825feaa:All quiet right now though, aside from the loud, angry chants.
f96ca301-36e5-42bd-b5c0-3dd511983044:It's a crowd on a knife-edge.
fd15f381-dc59-47e0-9c44-0b3775ea4025:Thank you Daniel.
4c1af641-058a-4673-af5f-4c9be0fc39f6:JESUS!
c97cc617-499e-48e1-b6f9-771614b02692:What, what's happening?
530e28d0-66fd-4c14-8f28-5c3b8f4a18dc:Someone just threw a firebomb. Someone in the crowd..
0c6d5c53-ca2d-4e2b-9d0e-06843b1e6c6d:&lt;bzzt&gt;
ebda842a-21b8-42cc-a388-be257f6192a6:&lt;bzzt&gt;
8dcabe15-a867-4cb6-b967-4909be4297f5:Errr. Stick with us everyone.
cc4a46eb-bf75-4609-bb53-2421afbc5842:More as it happens on the developing story...
45bea5c8-94ff-4209-a6eb-87b5a4ae3989:... on Triple-N.
d182b03b-34cb-4bd7-a898-e084e005e8fa:Judge Matt Hass - on Triple-N!
f4e98a07-4933-4b5b-b668-5c3923f448c2:The voice of reason!
14007dfa-c04c-4c09-8196-abff2b40b2d0:The more I think, the more I realise - we need to thank them.
ab662549-8ab8-4dd6-a523-fbd6806dd105:We need to thank the US Army.
bbd2eb2e-c400-4c51-ad6f-97ea36ecb5be:Whatever this is, it isn't fun. It could've spread.
ff3b6d60-abb6-4b03-99a0-ed7baf6366bc:Right now, you could be sick.
eafb95d0-c842-4cdd-a5c1-64d98401a874:Your kids could be sick.
791dc9db-f0e1-4d4a-aa15-30e3f7d6b866:They were ready for their duty. They got involved.
4f110315-7bfe-4a67-800d-e5365eb59b72:They rolled out from their bases, and they protected America.
92b5842c-10a8-416e-b100-fd742519041d:They did it fast, and they did it effectively.
ed794a35-aa43-4eb7-aebd-337ca84c1712:They did it in one of the most militarily senstive areas in America.
7c7a9934-ede4-4aa9-910e-dfc59ba65fb6:God bless them.
607ed5d9-b5f3-49f8-8687-3325b24a3b25:There is an illness in there, and it is contained.
65fcc93b-670f-4826-80c5-818dafd39529:Yes, a lot of people are hurting.
79a09c8e-0872-4501-a4ee-8270595c6f68:Yes, it's unfortunate that familes have been divided. 
69ab15e6-5d71-42dc-b257-689a0d1cbdf9:People kept from their homes? That's never good.
5d4c327d-57ea-498b-a949-da4ff4f8c066:But this is swift, decisive action.
9854f45b-9c31-4a78-9859-a4d19686429c:A threat is being dealt with.
89e7d3aa-706c-4362-938f-f04ca730cff6:That illness in the Exclusion Zone? It's trapped.
3433cccb-5d67-467b-89f2-bcb69677b093:The Army is biding its time. Making sure we stay safe.
01ca6b0b-a5c5-41fb-a688-5f803c2ffc0a:Have faith America. 
5a9f555d-d684-4b95-a0f5-0cda4d1d76e2:Faith will let us grow.
5e08a424-4830-4dfc-aee2-90e599c47756:Y'know, I understand the pain. 
ea5f568e-34e3-4c17-ac52-c0dc01506ea2:I'm not just some big-shot big mouth on the TV.
6806da90-a54c-47f6-a34b-d36716383eb5:I'm worried too. I'm worried as hell.
8e4a59ad-04c0-46bd-af98-a8a8129dd81c:I believe in our ability to deal with the Knox Event...
6a915ffe-ad28-4bad-b2a0-a8d56c770d86:... but there are unknowns. Unknowns make me nervous.
3334207b-5dba-4695-a88a-2226651b557c:But nervous enough to break into a store and take a VCR?
3463f3e6-0c0c-4c4b-8982-258d5c35e4cb:Nervous enough to distract our forces and emergency services?
70db4ba1-e8cb-4256-a547-cd2f778820f2:That's not even real to me. Not even real.
e66482cf-c15e-4a6a-8178-ff3a2a45b204:Be scared, sure. 
83c8af90-86c8-4cbd-a0db-e5dc64c292c3:Just don't let that fear turn to crazy.
8319a97c-1e3c-4041-ab14-2571a08055c6:We're in this together.
e7298b2b-65c4-45fb-99da-dd7d442f4aa7:I've been hearing a load of phooey about 'the end-times'.
a615cfb7-1aed-4dc1-8123-7973c44d4ba9:The Event, the riots, the communications black-out...
a9210756-98a9-414e-84be-737fd33d1b22:I'm asking you now, what changed?
f8594010-e993-42f6-804f-be411fab5b1a:What's changed in past few days, aside from panic?
3cfefeea-23c5-4e2a-84ab-a5188ccb5a5e:Look at our police force, look at our doctors and nurses.
a70356fb-711e-46c8-9d7e-2a79e41b76aa:Follow their example.
6aee605e-169c-45a2-968d-25af6c60bbb6:Here's a word you might not know - 'Stoicism'.
db849211-acd4-4b17-b6e4-3e8bda1dc3c4:It's Greek. Means you get on with it.
582a59f8-21ef-4b1e-9e03-08c4d9b7c485:It means you trust in people to get things done.
5c667439-a50a-4872-96b5-33bc153f9fa0:That was Judge Matt Hass. Good evening, you're on...
1d3c4eed-ea61-4810-8ab9-ae8fb5bfef0a:This is Triple-N. 
d77b7a00-5dcf-42b1-8bf2-a69fc8293a9e:A night of chaos. The night our cities exploded with anger.
f268ef31-daa7-4358-88ef-d76cd2d5545e:In Washington: protests turn ugly. Battle lines form in the street.
d208ae8e-9141-4c27-b8db-75d20866438c:In Los Angeles: arson, looting and public disorder.
eb01f81e-3d03-4ca8-b724-0686033e9c93:This morning: the President responds.

540cc7bd-3628-4f5b-b586-fb8953317fe8:I hope not. I see activity, and I see action.
9001cc1a-5458-47e0-ac91-db4454a2642f:That was sorely lacking in Raleigh.
4b52dc37-cf29-4124-8169-894788428c3b:There were more journalists than specialists in the temporary hospitals.
6b8504e1-0bec-4636-a5c0-2a22639d3b35:I recall. Several of my colleagues contracted the infection.
204cc740-c50c-4c22-bd46-92994f300801:It made for good copy from the quarantine camps.
4fb8804e-9c9d-4696-be13-b2bfc52ddac8:So it added to the hysteria too.
76a2c3cb-c322-49e1-843c-3d93995a9ff7:I'm at peace with it all now. Since the court ruling.
ce8926d6-9488-46d2-bda9-ec3ddef406de:But I spent so much of my time fighting to get Suzanne's voice heard.
7806ad81-2e36-4f4b-b577-56d5d0c7703e:And when I look at how efficient the response to the Event has been...

7291af6e-8dea-4011-ab2b-54b48ec9c9e8:But sometimes you've just got to survive, right?
1886312f-e076-4361-b745-f4e6bc8c9c10:Today we're building what I call a 'Wooden Cage Trap'.
3e3dc4ba-124a-4db2-95bd-e64a66f7704c:It's this cage you build out of wood.

678c9acd-0d48-4b64-ade3-00e5e1d82854:Just... chuck in some bait like this and get outta there.
07800c34-064f-47ab-975e-1160593e38b8:When you come back?
6e49f4b3-8706-413e-a92d-5f03f201eea6:Maybe there'll be a little animal guy there. 
45e706f7-6b9b-4d1c-a9b4-2f5b1ee11518:Ready for the pot.

3ec9a450-f0da-4c27-9053-ce202dee9cd9:You'll notice you haven't heard Tim the past few days. 
936437d7-73ae-4051-b419-4eb7f0e76e7f:No recipes. No weather. No Tim.
61b1d42c-56d4-41a1-b9f8-1424e54c18bc:He's inside the Exclusion Zone.
37bd503a-b2c0-4a49-a284-08cfac11c2d2:He doesn't even know we had to put the dog to sleep.
7da48909-92a1-439e-aa5f-a49aa2035d63:If you know anything, anything at all...
62dc5f59-a27a-41de-a0b4-b72bff620544:...find a way to talk to us.
c51e6262-4413-49df-9b30-854fdf057e94:The phones are cut-off. 
b7ccfbe3-3bb8-4ee7-a163-1fbfadf9dd07:The roads have checkpoints.
9d044719-977a-4103-bfba-ded967693d2a:This is too big.
54ee3763-ded3-465e-abd4-93770265475a:Way too big for us to just... believe... 
18d5aa17-8dbc-494e-858d-2426f9557e64:...what they say.
1046a459-6ead-4145-acc5-192fa0e4398d:LBMW this morning: tellin' us to 'stay indoors'.
aeb6cc38-1589-4c3b-8962-b5f66a0409d9:Thanks guys. How about you actually do some reports?
8c5cd14c-d3fb-4448-8063-2fdbcb27be4f:Tell us what's going on in there.
74702d9e-e206-4d1d-a847-00d5a5d58add:You can't just turn out the lights over that many counties.
ac7f9d7b-3ea1-42da-9353-459494466f01:It's 1993, not the dark ages.
aa3bb915-7950-4f40-a1a3-b51a0406f5d9:You can't keep a lid on this stuff.

e27bbbb1-7795-4a9f-87a9-7637214dd5c6:I thought I'd try to check out the camp over on the Event border.
b6d1894b-ef90-400a-baf8-dc609e4d0a70:Didn't get very far.
6368aab6-5aaa-4755-ae69-6228aad0274e:I even tried this little back road. All blocked.

d0602169-e031-4c5c-a4a4-1c8e3cef3747:Guns at each checkpoint.

c3dae23b-ea74-4114-87b7-033a7767869a:I'm watching the TV. Listening to the radio.
f63e897a-44ae-41e1-ae81-c5ff5f8ab098:I'm sorry to use the word but it's all... bull crap.
78fe1f51-fc79-4184-ab60-6daf81951a46:Reporters over there, sitting in bed with the Army. 
367bd1f6-11d2-4e73-b99d-d807f4266baf:Feeding off their scraps.
98c4da00-692d-426a-adb9-1ae1a22e7668:We KNOW there are guns being fired.
4ad9ed92-b98a-4197-b6df-b314dcb9ed1d:We KNOW they didn't all catch cold.
42eb12ae-1fc5-444e-acea-1fe74eb452f3:We KNOW those people are.. 
8b6b23eb-9c28-4faf-9603-120f33d6b150:...changed somehow.
aca8e4df-f458-4cff-a987-6fa9541f31d2:That's what I heard.

d027f502-97bc-4798-93a0-8918fecbe87a:We had a major convoy headed through towards the Exclusion border.
95f4c4f9-017e-4cbf-b1de-1beac2a41572:The things I'm saying - not many folks are saying them out loud.
5860e0a6-552e-4934-ae5f-3a67b088e2d3:I got jumpy. 
8ea96027-e5e3-4f04-beb5-16b0fe1cc056:Thought they were here for me.
02bc7ec5-e62e-41df-84e9-0a924931b0c1:Guess they have bigger fish to fry.
61cb755b-b781-4bcd-b50a-33141f1008e2:They're pushing back the exclusion boundary. 
c9756761-deca-47f4-ba2b-5ee61e9b53c0:I can't tell you where I am, but I think I'm gonna be left inside.
17dbdf7c-6f9b-463e-b648-36790928ac0a:I'm going to stay, and I'm going to keep on talking to you.
6fe532f4-ee43-4c84-bff8-150906e4c1f4:I'm taking my equipment.
3a1c813c-e786-49b5-873d-26a34674bb74:I'm gonna hide someplace wild when they come.

63954b97-7bb4-4669-b7d4-a44448c30d12:It's from West Point, taken a few days ago I guess.
8b3e61ce-348f-4c7c-b162-1edf403ae5a6:The film got out. Got processed.
5e78a099-f226-4d94-8800-ccfa1b45e430:There's this guy. Blood round his mouth. 
29b651a0-6642-4539-a82e-38f5abdfa3b6:Arm hanging on him by a thread.
ad37c1c3-c0d4-4319-8960-dfb478323b49:Still walking.
3cbdc6d5-23ff-4ab3-8ad8-ecc07c929bf9:Still walking in this street full of corpses.
31663750-2b15-4fdc-88f3-b50d1bdc035d:We know the truth now.

0b5466b0-e674-400f-909c-ecdaf75a2461:We KNOW we're being lied to.
5ec8fd0e-29f3-471b-9a97-3c21f2295cda:You know why they don't care, right?
12c94bbb-220a-4b53-b41e-e3c87ef597ae:You know why the world can just sit by?
3025db04-a199-401d-9af1-dc0cdd4a2eeb:Watch a community blink out?
f886f7f9-ffef-4bb0-9a5c-ba0cc6d46fbe:It's because we're poor.
b5776491-1647-4dd4-84a0-03af2adf15b7:If this was New York, or Chicago or... anywhere.
86f9a8ed-5da8-46ce-93c9-654390452439:People would care. They'd be up in arms.
1556b8e7-af84-441a-a819-93a6884ebc6d:The media would give a shit.
866d4f08-e855-4a95-ac7a-4f9328c73687:We don't get movies made about us.
44be57bb-1f2e-49a8-8090-49be45c4a6c8:We're not interesting.
cfefccd8-f216-4e4a-be63-a072874c1076:We just live a hard life as best we can.
e90ef88e-eab1-46bf-9df8-9690096a342c:Only, that's not enough.
ad144bda-1fa3-472f-bb61-dbb3dcc11e4c:So we're on our own.

32abd42b-4d25-4775-bc38-3dbfd3e67414:They're shooting anyone that goes to leave.
605dba57-91df-4fc9-b6f3-432aad90d13b:There's no checks.
e13caba7-2e82-4051-a69f-87622707044d:They don't examine for any infection. 
34bfd86e-e27b-4607-ac72-02ff12c02009:They shout a warning, then you get a bullet.
